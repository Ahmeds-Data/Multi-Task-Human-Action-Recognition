# Multi-Task Human Action Recognition

### Project Overview

Human Action Recognition (HAR) involves identifying actions performed by individuals from images or videos. This project focuses on developing a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize actions from still images. The system is designed to predict both the specific action of a person and whether there are multiple people in the image.


### Key Objectives

- Action Recognition: Identify the action performed by a person in an input RGB image (Multi-Classification of 40 classes)
- Multi-Person Detection: Determine if more than one person is present in the image (Binary Classification)
